franco.js uses [ttezel's twit module](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) to listen on the twitter stream API for mentions of James Franco to retweet and favorite them. 

I currently use it with twitter account @HeyJamesFranco to push out 100 retweets an hour, or 2400 retweets a day - the maximum amount of activity allowed by twitter.
